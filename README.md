# BioniDKU OS Updates 
This repository hosts software update releases for something known as **BioniDKU OS images**.

**BioniDKU OS images** is a series of heavily customized Windows installations built on top of a specially modified BioniDKU experience. This was my way of hosting my own challenges, and also served as the test ground for ***some*** features that would be ported to the regular BioniDKU. 
These OS images are made for and are only available for the people in my private community, and thus are **not open source.** 

So far, the following images, and along with them, the challenges, were made and held: 
- **BioniDKU OSFE** | *First edition* (December 2022)
- **BioniDKU OSSE** | *Second edition* (January - March 2023)
- **BioniDKU OSTE** | *Third edition* (July - September 2023)<sup>1</sup>
- **BioniDKU OSXE** | *eXperimental edition* (January - April 2024)
- **BioniDKU OSXEv2** |  *eXperimetnal edition, version 2* (July - October 2024)
- **BioniDKU OSXEv3** | *eXperimetnal edition, version 3* (July 2025)

<sup>(1) The update system was first introduced in BioniDKU OSTE.</sup>

Prior to the creation of this repository, all updates were held in a different (now privated) repository. Reuploading them here would be a hassle (and pointless), thus, only the latest/final update for each images at the time of writing this `README.md` will be made available. If any of the contestant wish to accquire a certain update, please contact me on Discord.
